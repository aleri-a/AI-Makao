This is project which is using Alpha Beta prunning with Transposition tables, and with limitation on time for making decision. 



RULES:
Game is similar to UNO. 

1. card with num 1
If the player on the table put 1 ie A, he must to put another card on it , if he don't have he must to buy one and if the new card is proper he can throw it but that is not mandatory, he can keep it. 
2. card with 2 tref 
 another player is taking 4 cards
3. card with num 7 
another player need to take 2 cars, or he can put another 7 and the first player need to take 4. After taking that 4 cards, if it is putted again 7 it is starting from beginning ie another person don't need to take 6cards ie he just need to take 2. 
4. card with num 8 
The same player is playing again

5. card with num J
This card can change the sign on the top of table.  




BAGS in the project: 
- on UI side it is using only one thread, it can be seen as slow updating of pictures of cards.
- it can stop working if there is putted more times card 7, because on the side of UI, in order to prevent to calculate more times number 7 there can be found numbers such as 33,66 etc.  

Positiv stuffs:
There is implemented algorithm for puting example: 8, J, 8, A so in this case one person can win easily
